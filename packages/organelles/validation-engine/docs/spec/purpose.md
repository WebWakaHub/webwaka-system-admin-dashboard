# ValidationEngine Organelle — Purpose & Responsibility

**Organelle:** ORG-FV-VALIDATION_ENGINE-v0.1.0
**Version:** 0.1.0
**Layer:** Organelle (smallest functional unit)

## Purpose

The ValidationEngine organelle is responsible for providing a self-contained, deterministic
functional unit within the WebWaka biological hierarchy. It encapsulates a single
domain responsibility and exposes well-defined ports for interaction with other organelles.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **State Management:** Maintain internal state through a deterministic state machine
2. **Event Processing:** Accept and emit domain events through typed interfaces
3. **Invariant Preservation:** Enforce all declared invariants at every state transition
4. **Observability:** Expose telemetry, metrics, and audit data through standard ports

## Boundary Conditions

- This organelle operates within a Cell container
- It communicates only through its declared ports
- It must not hold references to other organelles directly
- All mutations must be auditable and reversible
